## Overview

This project is inspired by the work of Rafael Pedreiro, a Brazilian craftsman who shares his physical labor videos online, particularly his wall-building projects. These videos are fascinating when sped up using a timelapse technique, and the goal of this project is to bring a similar experience to programming live streams.

In 2025, I decided to try something new: recording programming sessions with a timelapse effect to make them more engaging and dynamic. The timelapse effect allows viewers to see long coding sessions in just a few seconds.

## Features

- **Timelapse Recording:** This Python script records your screen and accelerates the video, creating a timelapse effect.
- **Dual Monitor Support:** The script splits the screen into two parts: one side shows your code editor, and the other shows the website or app you're working on.
- **Dual Video Formats:** The script generates two video formats:
  - Horizontal: The original screen recording.
  - Vertical: The screen is split vertically with the code editor at the bottom and the website at the top.
- **Pause for Normal Speed Recording:** When detailed explanations are needed, the timelapse can be paused for normal-speed recording, similar to the technique used by Rafael Pedreiro to narrate over his videos.

## How It Works

The Python script uses screen recording to capture your workspace. By reducing the frames per second (FPS), it speeds up the recording to create a timelapse effect. The result is a video that shows hours of work in just seconds, which can be very engaging for viewers.

## Learning Experience

This project helped me realize the following:
- Programming is slow, even when sped up.
- AI and tools like ChatGPT can speed up the process but not as much as expected.
- Publicly sharing your work, like Rafael Pedreiro does, requires skill, focus, and high-quality output.

## Open Source

This project is open source and available on GitHub. It is part of my efforts at f5sites to enhance video editing workflows. It will also integrate with my AI system to automatically publish timelapse videos on social media.
